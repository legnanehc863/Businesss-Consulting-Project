There are a couple of things that I love about monday.com. The first is that I can automate tasks to be more comfortable when doing other activities. The second is that I can organize my projects in an easy and orderly way. I also like your support to worry about responding to my requests on time, as well as being very intuitive, easy to use and with a relatively accessible price to the public.  Review collected by and hosted on G2.com. What do you dislike? I do not like that the program contains a sidebar to include information or task parameters, I feel that this makes what you want to show something cumbersome. In addition to this, I have nothing more to say, just that and I hope they improve it.  Review collected by and hosted on G2.com. Recommendations to others considering the product: It really complies with what is established and that is why we continue to use it daily. We can organize a lot of organization and it is excellent for the management of our projects. It has a lot of intuition when using it and you will undoubtedly love this as well as all the advantages mentioned above.  Review collected by and hosted on G2.com. What problems are you solving with the product?  What benefits have you realized? Since we implement it in the company we use it to maintain control and order of our weekly activities. The workers are under strict control of our planning thanks to monday.com. In turn this has brought us benefits of greater time savings and optimized workflow because we can have total control of some departments. It is amazing to automate tasks when we are traveling.

I appreciate that it is easy and versatile. I appreciate the arranging of tables in as many various circumstances. There is also a wonderful functionality of the board: we have our BI tool linked onto it. I enjoy the opportunity to interact with my teams optimized efficiently to follow the current objectives and demands of our organization. The personalization of Monday will enable visible progress in our projects to be observed and to know what future measures are needed to complete the project. Automation is essential and on Monday it is beneficial and important to be easy to use.  Review collected by and hosted on G2.com. What do you dislike? I couldn't discover any issues that I don't enjoy about the service. You will receive e-mails with all the updates, publications or automated actions, but this allows secondary security for everyone involved or responsible for a project, and I feel that it is very relevant to everyone to know what is going on and there is no confusion or unnecessary delay due to the absence of the data.  Review collected by and hosted on G2.com. Recommendations to others considering the product: If you have communication or project management demands, and you still do not have to find a solution, try Monday. It is a completely configurable solution for project management and communication. Set targets, expand the needs, give solutions and accomplish the task. It is connected with Google Calendar, Gmail and a phone request to use while it is not in the workplace. It's easy to implement. They provide monthly webinars and lots of supporting videos covering anything you wish to present. There is also a forum for project moderators. It takes a little more time, but a system is necessary, and once utilized properly, it can have a small bit of it.  Review collected by and hosted on G2.com. What problems are you solving with the product?  What benefits have you realized? We tracked many databases, interactions and activities in our office. We also utilize a template for a pipeline and thus pick this product. The connection to our contact table is helpful. It is good, too. Automation is the primary item for the application's consumer, making it easy for people who are not highly expert to utilize and simplify our procedure. It might take a minute or two to browse to that project to make a remark on a project joint or a project update. It's still working, the most essential thing. The advantages are countless. Login, check where the projects are, view my reports and I'm set to start.  Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.\"}\n",

I love that all of our departments can come together as a big team in one place to work on projects that overlap with seamless communication. The platform through automation also allows us to work between departments and pass projects along in the process without leaving the platform, this ensures all updates that have happened along the way are visible and answers a lot of questions without the need for repeated dialog or meetings.  Review collected by and hosted on G2.com. What do you dislike? There are some automation limitations right now that will be great once expanded to things like dropdown columns and such. It would also be nice if some of the views and subitems could have the option to be customized under each item.  Review collected by and hosted on G2.com. Recommendations to others considering the product: The team at Monday.com is amazing, I would highly recommend talking to them about what your needs are and what the platform can do for your company. Their expertise and constant innovation keep things moving to allow new offerings and solutions regularly.  Review collected by and hosted on G2.com. What problems are you solving with the product?  What benefits have you realized? We have used monday.com as a solution to Workflow efficiency. We have found that it is so much easier than searching for those informational emails, especially in communication and updates. It has also allowed us to shorten or even eliminate some of our meetings as we can see the updates on projects in real-time and don't need to share all of that information in a meeting.

The calendar and ability to see the week at a glance, as well as what's coming up next week. The difference between inbox messages (something you likely have to reply to that's direct to you) versus bell notifications  (things are happening on one of your projects, but you are not being directly asked anything) is helpful too. Mobile app is a pretty good iteration that's adapted for a phone, not just a clunky version of the desktop app made smaller.  Review collected by and hosted on G2.com. What do you dislike? Ensuring that someone sees your message by @replying to them doesn't always work via email replies to a thread from notifications (minor quibble really).  Review collected by and hosted on G2.com. Recommendations to others considering the product: More intuitive and streamlined than Basecamp, so Monday.com could be a better choice for teams who are not as experienced with using software for project management.

Monday.com allows users to create many different boards to work on projects and collaborate. I like the ability to have many various automations set up and the ability to have notifications in the platform and email. The amount of customization is excellent, and the ability to get things done and keep the information up to date is fantastic.  Review collected by and hosted on G2.com. What do you dislike? Monday.com is a bit challenging to really understand at the beginning. The learning curve is high, but once you get there, it is pretty easy to use. And then, from there, there is a lot you can get done. And there is another steep cliff to become an expert in it. It is easy to use, but to become an expert, you will want to have someone dedicated to maintaining the platform. It has a lot of excellent capabilities, but it is hard to access them all.  Review collected by and hosted on G2.com. What problems are you solving with the product?

I really love how you're able to customize tables to your liking fully. It allows our team to create some really thoughtful, organized brainstorming spaces.

What do you dislike? I honestly can't think of a thing that I dislike about the program. If I really had to nitpick, I'd say that maybe the interface could be a tiny bit more intuitive, but it's really great as is. I don't think there are really any improvements to be made. A+++!  Review collected by and hosted on G2.com. Recommendations to others considering the product: I would highly recommend Monday.com! It has been an invaluable tool that has really helped our team take their productivity & task management to the next level.  Review collected by and hosted on G2.com. What problems are you solving with the product?  What benefits have you realized? Monday.com has helped out team solve a number of problems. When we were all in the office it kept us more organized than the paper method we were using. We had pinup boards with ideas so Monday is a lot more eco-friendly because we aren't using all that paper. It has also been a huge help in keeping team members on task while working at home this past year. Monday has allowed us to create team projects and maintain a solid deadline while incorporating all of the necessary details. Not only is it a great organizational tool, it's a fantastic communication tool as well. I would highly recommend this to any team that works on complex projects in a remote fashion.

Recommendations to others considering the product: I would highly suggest it because it is the reason our company is so well put together now.

Review collected by and hosted on G2.com. What do you dislike? Monday.com could use some improvements in the way that it handles data loading.

Centralized task management across a geographically distributed team working on varied schedules.  Major uptick in ensuring that no task \"gets lost\" and forgotten, prioritization can be done by one person/team and all assigned resources are updated on the new prioritization immediately without the need for excessive calls/discussions.  Ability to attach documents for requirements, illustrations, screenshots, etc. is fast and seamless.  Ultimately has resulted in much higher productivity and customer response velocity while minimizing \"dropped balls\".

Professionals can project cumulative grades and credit weight by including them. I'd rather the desktop platform, but it's nice as well. Every day, I use it to track the time and the state you spend on my chores. The platform is vibrant and much more fun to use. It's also fantastic to see my partner boards knowing what they're working on at the moment and what's the timetable you need to accomplish.  Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.

Monday.com has a vast amount of functionality for the beginner user all the way to the wizard level super sleuths.  Review collected by and hosted on G2.com. What do you dislike? Due to the insane level of depth, you can get into to create the perfect functionality you want – it can get a little overwhelming when creating very complex project boards. But remember fortune favours the brave.  Review collected by and hosted on G2.com. Recommendations to others considering the product: Before getting too deep into creating your boards know what you are looking to achieve and features you want at the beginning. It's not too tricky to change things but may take a bit of time to get it organised correctly.  Review collected by and hosted on G2.com. What problems are you solving with the product?  What benefits have you realized? We use Monday.com to keep individual to-do lists to make sure we all know what tasks need completing. We schedule projects for our internal reference as well as letting clients feel a part of the process by seeing how each stage deadline affects the next.

I like the user interface of monday.com, makes tracking projects very easy. It is straightforward and very convenient to navigate. Makes project discussions at each point also very easy. You can easily reference team members and discuss points on every item and sub item. You can also create templates so you dont have to create the same boards every time. it has saved my and team members time a lot  Review collected by and hosted on G2.com. What do you dislike? Nothing really that I dislike but I haven't been able to find the best way to summarize all the projects status together. I am sure it is there, I just need to figure it out.

I love the automation features the most.  Review collected by and hosted on G2.com. What do you dislike? No pictures or screenshots on dashboards  Review collected by and hosted on G2.com. Recommendations to others considering the product: My advice would be to have a growth mindset about learning this new tool. The more effort put into using this tool and catering it to your needs, the more benefits you will get out of it. Sometimes it can be easy to resist change, but Monday.com is worth it. For the clinic I work for, Monday.com has streamlined so many processes and has minimized the need to track down a long list of email chains. It is effective in keeping all parties up to date in REAL time. I have also used Monday.com for my task lists. As a reporting analyst, I have several reports that I send out each month. The automation feature has allowed my tasks to be created for me each month without thinking about all the data reports I need to get done. Monday.com does the work so that you can focus on completing your job in the best and most efficient way possible. It is important to remember, though, that Monday.com is a relatively new project management platform. Because of this, there are some features of Monday.com that are not as user-friendly as others. For example, although, for the most part, the automation feature is fantastic, there are some shortcomings with it. It allows you to customize to a certain extent, but there are some limitations. Monday.com makes up for this lack of features by having an incredible support team. They have been easy to contact and communicate with, and that level of customer service has made a world of difference.  Review collected by and hosted on G2.com. What problems are you solving with the product?  What benefits have you realized? We are minimizing communication through long email chains.

We no longer have to maneuver multiple shared drives on different platforms because everything relevant to a project can simply go on monday.com.  Review collected by and hosted on G2.com. What do you dislike? There is very little I could find to complain about, but I do wish I knew of a way to more easily duplicate boards and keep various tasks without carrying over all of the files and comments. There may be a way to achieve this more easily than what I'm currently doing, but I haven't discovered it yet.  Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.

With part of our team still on remote, Monday lets us keep track of each team member through out the day.

Monday.com has saved our team so much extra time by helping us manage a hugely busy workload. As a small team, we're spread very thin, so having the right tools to help us effectively manage our time and resources is paramount to our success.  Monday is easy to use, and the UI is straightforward, making it easy to navigate. More importantly, we're able to customize the boards to the various needs of each project, ensuring that we have a way to track a variety of different completion and progress metrics. We've also made great use of the automation to automatically move tasks to new boards, keeping work moving so no time is wasted waiting for someone to click a button to reassign it.  Finally, we have that the ability to tag and alert people to changes, needs, or other vital information on tasks has helped ensure nothing falls through the cracks.  Review collected by and hosted on G2.com. What do you dislike? The inability to convert items to subitems and vice-versa, and the failure to move things (along with their sub-items) across boards. This is an important capability that has cost us time. Unfortunately, we had to restructure some of our boards, and not being able to do this with one click cost us time as we had to go in and re-create each task one by one.  Review collected by and hosted on G2.com. Recommendations to others considering the product: Research the other tools, try them out for a few days. You will likely see that they are not as flexible or intuitive in use as Monday.  Review collected by and hosted on G2.com. What problems are you solving with the product?  What benefits have you realized? Mainly we are solving the challenges that come with tracking many simultaneous projects with subsequent actions under each one. Most of what we work on is not a single task. It is layers of tasks, with dependencies and simultaneous workstreams that must progress in a metered and calculated manner to ensure the final product has everyhthing it needs. Rarely do we operate with deadlines months in advance, so being able to track everything quickly and easily is very important to our team's ability to complete our work. Add to that the challenge that we are not currently in an office, and not being able to walk over to a collegue's desk adds major challenges for communication and clarity.  We are actively looking at bringing our sales team on to monday.com to try and even further eliminate the communications gap and ensure that our teams are working even more effectively. Generally, wev'e benefitted from greater communication, enhanced teamwork and likley a copius amount of time saved.  Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.\"}\n",

I do like the automation feature set. You have an easy way to integrate other tools and make IF THIS THEN DO THAT automation in your boards. An additional upside I like is that you can share boards with external people without creating an account, and you can limit what this user can and cannot do. Their support team is really active and helpful, some colleagues have used support and the answer came very fast.  Review collected by and hosted on G2.com. What do you dislike? Sometimes I feel the website slows a little bit, and the automation takes an extra time or the need for a page reload. You also have some limitations that don't make any sense; for example, you can't migrate subitems of an item when you move this item between boards, so guarantee that you won't have to make this kind of migration soon.
