It really helps to improve your productivity, you can see exactly what is happening, who's responsible for each task, when it needs to be completed. It makes the work clear and easier. I also like some functionalities like the cronogram, the panel, advanced researches, custom fields. These functionalities make Asana different than the other similar tools.  Review collected by and hosted on G2.com. What do you dislike? I think Asana should automatize more the Goals feature and to provide a dashboard on the Portfolios just like there is on the Projects.

Review collected by and hosted on G2.com. What do you dislike? The software is not super intuitive; there is a significant learning curve. Difficult to onboard someone new to the platform - it takes a long time to get them up and running. Additionally, I wish Asana had more functionality to automate regularly cadenced workflows - like resurfacing quarterly/annual campaigns we run at previously noted timeframes. If Asana had these future-facing automated workflows, it would definitely be a 10/10 for me.  Review collected by and hosted on G2.com. What problems are you solving with the product?

It\\'s not necessarily a \"jump in and go!\" type of tool. But if you take the time to learn it and figure out the nuances, it\\'s very effective.  Review collected by and hosted on G2.com. What problems are you solving with the product?  What benefits have you realized? Asana has become the foundation for all of our projects and helped us streamline our project management process.

Thanks to Asana!', 'Review': {'Use Cases and Deployment Scope': \"Asana is being used to assign tasks throughout the entire organization. We have remote employees in Canada, the United States, India and the Philippines. Due to everyone working in different time zones, communication becomes a problem. By assigning tasks via Asana, everyone knows your schedule for the day and when a task is completed, the next task can start by the next person in line. Previously, we used Wrike and Trello but these tools did not provide a proper way of communicating among the team members. In Wrike, when a person up the project line changes a task's due date to a later time which affects the entire down line, there's no way of informing the other affected employees. For Trello, it was more like a post-it note. Good for planning but not easy to hold people accountable for tasks not being completed.\", 'Pros and Cons': 'Able to create a template that can be copied. This is good for projects that has to be constantly repeated. For example, on-boarding a new employee.Able to assign due dates and tasks dependency. So for example, if Task B is dependent on Task A being completed and Task A was moved to a different date, employee assigned to do Task B will be informed of the change of due date of Task A.On a daily basis, everyone is able to see what needs to be done for the day and prioritize their time accordingly. And managers can easily check if tasks assigned to employees for the week is too little or too much and tweak assignments easily.EditThe ability to assign projects based on templates with a start date and the number of required days per task. In this case, Wrike is more capable. For example, if I know Task A needs 3 days to complete before Task B can start, I would like the ability to assign Task A to start on Monday and have Asana automatically assign Task B to start on Thursday when template is being copied. Unfortunately, this is not possible with Asana.', 'Likelihood to Recommend': 'Asana is well suited for companies with employees in different time zones. Everyone starts work at a different time but with the tasks assignment system, everyone knows when a task is required to be completed and when it can be started. I think Asana works among cross-functional teams too. For example, if the marketing department needs design work to be done before handing off to an outside agency for advertisement, people from different teams are involved. The project owner can scope out the entire project and start assigning tasks to stakeholders. And when the stakeholders get the assigned tasks, it is easy to communicate among the entire organization if they have comments or issues through the assigned task. Best of all, everyone is held accountable for the tasks assigned to them. If a due date is changed or if tasks are not completed, managers can hold the task owner accountable for the delay. I find that Asana also makes employees more accountable for their actions if they know that everyone involved in the project is aware of their actions or inaction.', 'Support Rating': 'Personally, I have not contacted Asana customer service. But seeing how Asana has improved over the last 2 years, I feel that Asana is listening to their users and implementing changes to help make it better.

Other project management tools don't have as nice an interface as Asana has.It allows you to manage a LOT of projects and to customize them separately depending on the characteristics of each one.It works smoothly in different navigators and also the desktop version works very well.It allows integrations with great tools, such as Everhour.EditThe free version is very plain, I understand that nothing's for free but I think that, if it had some more functionalities available in the free version more people would buy the complete one.I would like to use Asana in my phone without having to download the app.Sometimes the notifications get spammy, I know you can deactivate some and activate others but, as default, they end up being spam and most of the times I lose the only ones I care about (when a task is done and when comments are made on a task).\", 'Likelihood to Recommend': \"In my experience, Asana solved a lot of problems where I work, a growing department at a growing company. When we had fewer clients (or small clients) it was easy to work without a friendly project management tool, but when clients got bigger and we started to [have] A LOT our work became messy and stressful. I think it's a well suited tool when your area or your company gets bigger.\", 'Support Rating': \"Honestly I had to ask them for support only one time, so I can't rate them properly. That one time they gave me adequate support and the response came in an adequate time too. Being a tool as easy to use as it is -  it's not very frequent that we need support from them.\"}}\n",

It enabled us to timeline out the project, share with the wider team and list to-dos. It worked well as the project was a rush so we were able to highlight key areas that needed addressing quickly by the client.', 'Pros and Cons': \"Waterfall view of the timeline.I like the drag/drop feature, and simplicity of using the tool.EditLimited functionality.You're able to see the big picture of what we need to accomplish, but not a great collaborating tool if the team is remote.I found it tricky to sign-up and get set up in the tool.\", 'Likelihood to Recommend': \"Asana is great for high-level timelines and sharing with clients. It gives a great snapshot of everything we need to achieve or have already completed. I wouldn't describe the tool as full-service as I couldn't really collaborate in it or work on risks/opportunities. However, it is great for sharing directly with clients. For this reason, I would recommend it. \", 'Support Rating': \"I haven't had to use the support for Asana yet! \"}}\n",

It's used extensively by most of the company. Our Dev team still uses JIRA for running its sprints, however, marketing, operations, and business development all use Asana and it has helped us coordinate better and reduce lag time between departments.\", 'Pros and Cons': \"Task management - It helps us keep track of all of the tasks that we're working on, prioritizing them, and making sure that they get completed.Team collaboration - It makes it easy to work with other teams/departments and collaborate together.EditI would love the ability to comment on files in the app. If someone uploads a pdf or a doc that needs review, then I have to download it, comment on it, and then reupload it. I would love it if it had a way to make comments on the document itself.I wish that I could see all of the tasks that I'm a follower of. If you're not the one that the task is assigned to, then it doesn't show up in your feed. Having some sort of report of tasks that you're a follower on would be really helpful.\", 'Likelihood to Recommend': \"We do a lot of cross-team/department work so it's been really nice to tag someone in the task and ask for their review/approval. They can easily pop into the task, review, approve, and leave comments for us to review. It's sped up our process and eliminated drag in our organization. It is also really nice to have a paper trail of what was communicated and to refer back to in cases where we're not sure what we agreed upon on previously.\", 'Support Rating': \"I haven't had to have any interactions with their customer support. So, I guess that means they get a 10 because I never have to talk to them! When the recent system outage happened, they were very active on twitter trying to communicate with people and give an update on what was going on.\"}}\n",
