Tracking all our design work.\"', 'Review': 'What do you like best? Collaboration and objective evidence for every state of the project. We are an ISO company so having all this data for the auditor helps us so much with our compliance. We received our first ISO audit since implementing Wrike on a small scale and our auditor was so impressed he said we would recommend this program to other companies struggling to capture as much data as possible. All meetings are captured, phone calls transcribed. Approvals are submitted in real time and the whole team can see the status of anything at a glance. Notifications help us to stay up to date along with use of Gant charts where they apply.  Review collected by and hosted on G2.com. What do you dislike? The interface continues to evolve, which is excellent, but there is a learning curve each time there is a change. I would like to see a preview for PDFs like your get for photos. I sometimes screen capture my pdf and post that and the pdf to quickly see the attachment.  Review collected by and hosted on G2.com. Recommendations to others considering the product: It seems pricey but one project falling through the cracks is enough to justify the yearly subscription cost.

What benefits have you realized? Due date tracking, tasks, data trail, Engineering change requests (ECR), Customer satisfaction surveys, Work instruction sign offs and more things everyday. Live event tracking. Responsible party designations. Time tracking down to the individual task level with times built in for each task. Ability to attach any type of drawing to each task was critical to having a complete solution for us.

Our team would have crumbled in 2020 if it wasn\\'t for Wrike. COVID forced a lot of organizations to not only rethink but change how they work. My company was one of those. With the shift to remote work, Wrike helped us keep working. We were able to continue collaboration on projects and we were able to keep things on time. Wrike also helped us become more intentional about the projects we executed. We experienced a lot of turnover in 2020 and the first half of 2021. Having everyone\\'s work documented in Wrike allowed us to navigate those transitions more smoothly. The tools we use the most in Wrike are: Dashboards - to see who is doing what Workflows - to see the status of the work in progress  Review collected by and hosted on G2.com. What do you dislike? If I had one complaint about Wrike, it would be the limited options for integrating a digital asset manager (DAM). We crank out a lot of graphics and videos for internal departments. Having all of those in a centralized location makes the lives of our designers and producers so much easier. Having the integration with the DAM we currently use (PhotoshelterBrands) would eliminate two to three steps from their workflow.  Review collected by and hosted on G2.com. What problems are you solving with the product?  What benefits have you realized? One of our issues has been keeping up with multiple campaigns that are running simultaneously. Using Wrike Calendars and a custom status called \"Campaign In Progress,\" we have an at-a-glance view of everything that\\'s going on and how they overlap.

Wrike is a solid pm tool. we use it for our marketing team. Some teams (web, creative) use it as a ticketing/tracking system while the field and campaign marketers use it for full project management. The UI is easy to learn/use. Tagging, workflows, spaces, and the soldering system - while it can be a bit confusing to get it all nailed down at first - provides a ton of flexibility.  Review collected by and hosted on G2.com. What do you dislike? If you're looking for project mgmt, odds are good you don't only need a tool, but also some solid processes **and management of those processes** if you're really going to see success. If you only deploy it as a tool for your team to use as they see fit w/o some underlying rules, you'll leave your team in chaos. Each team will end up using it differently and, when those teams try to co-op on a project - which is the intent of having a project mgmt tool - it quickly becomes hard to distinguish who owns what and what stage a given task is under b/c everyone tracks differently.  Review collected by and hosted on G2.com. What problems are you solving with the product?  What benefits have you realized? We needed a pm tool to help us organize co-op'd projects. We were getting ready to launch a massive website rewrite, coordinating across multiple business units and we knew it was going to get messy. Emails were already getting lost; constant follow-up and baby-sitting ensued. We needed help. Wrike helped us organize our chaos - we took the first step. To avoid a stall, we need to step beyond the tool and organize our processes.  Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.\"}\n",

I love the consistency and transparency that we have with our team when using Wrike! We used to use too many spreadsheets and manila folders to track all of our jobs, which frequently got lost and resulted in staff wandering the office to look for the missing folders. Since we implemented Wrike, we now know the status of all jobs with a click of a mouse!  Review collected by and hosted on G2.com. What do you dislike? Some of my team have struggled with the switch over to the Wrike New Experience. At first, I also struggled with the transition, however since I have been using it for a few months, I now see the benefits and why Wrike made the decision to make the changes that they did. I am looking forward to continued improvements, as I have seen them steadily since we implemented Wrike in 2019.  Review collected by and hosted on G2.com. What problems are you solving with the product?  What benefits have you realized? One problem that we always had prior to Wrike was not ever knowing the status of a project without asking every person that was assigned to it. With Wrike, you can easily check the status of all projects without having to take up anyone else's time. Another problem that we were experiencing was a lack of timely responses due to too many emails in our inbox. They were getting mixed up vendors, clients, and internal emails. With Wrike, we have almost completely eliminated inter email communication and have moved that to strictly Wrike. This allows for a much more organized email inbox to be utilized with clients and vendors only.  Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.\"}\n",

By the time I have something to complain about, Wrike has refined or added a new feature or process to alleviate the issue.

Wrike has solved a major problem we faced in the past - stakeholder engagement. Our development team provides tremendous service and desired output levels for our clients. However, we sometimes forgot to pick our heads up to notify our project stakeholders in a timely manner. Now, with Wrike, we\\'re able to include stakeholders in our projects so they can request status updates (if we fail to be proactive), view the status of outstanding tasks, approve or deny product updates, attach relevant files and links, and remain in contact with us via the mobile app when they\\'re away from their desks.

What do you dislike? Because of initial login problems, the integration of new users became problematic but were overcome easily by the Wrike support team. The laptop variant doesn't perform much and slows down the actual job.

As Wrike has multiple procedures that can be streamlined without being present, the number of projects is higher each week. I appoint civil, design, operational, HR and technical personnel in each project. Wrike's method allows us to have timely input on the success of each new point of sale. This also stops us from getting and moving on repeated texts. All is unified in Wrike now.  Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.\"}\n",

Review collected by and hosted on G2.com. What problems are you solving with the product?  What benefits have you realized? We engaged with Wrike after reviewing multiple project management solutions to help with managing our agency. After multiple phone calls with the sales rep and him showing us the demo account, we landed on an agreement with Wrike with very specific needs we needed to solve for. 1. Workload  management, 2. Management of Retainer and Project Client billables and reporting including time roll-up, 3. Integration with our account software to eliminate manual invoicing 3. Planning option to share with clients for transparency and detailed planning. We were given access to a demo account and played around with it as much as we could however, we were not sure how to set up the account because the reps demo account was not structured for agency management even though he pushed the fact Wrike is built for agencies. We signed-up trusting that all of our primary needs would be solved for even paid for professional consulting. We were then given a consultant who didn't know anything about agency management and we walked away extremely worried that we received the classic bait and switch. Sales reps sells you a product. Ops tells you sorry we can't solve for your needs. We were given another consultant who tried to solve for our needs however after three meetings he was not able to fully help us. We even reach out to tech support and they told us we could not do what we needed to do. We found that roll-up times were wrong, reports were wrong, we could do billing even exporting. Then when I informed our account manager that the solution that we were sold and the requirements we laid out were not being met by their software I received 0 response until after 3 follow-ups. Then he brought in his Regional Manager who again just said he couldn't help us. After the blatant lack of customer support from these two and them only allowing us 30 minutes of their time, I demanded to speak to the VP of Sales. His response was nice and cordial unlike the other two reps we dealt with. However, as the trend of Wrike, no one again followed up after our call. I offered to pay for what we have used and the consulting but there is no way I'm paying $8k for a product that was sold to me and promised would work for our needs and doesn't. Customer support is the absolute worst, sales will sell you anything. If you are a marketing agency and only want a glorified task management system then spend the money however, we lost a lot of functionality going from Teamwork to Wrike. Teamwork solved for 80% of our needs -  Wrike solved for 30%. These worst decisions for a marketing agency project management solution and even worst customer support.

The team is receptive and asks a lot of good questions to understand our unique set-up and problems we're trying to solve. Other than that, it's the double-edge sword situation with updates... there's always so many new features which are great for tech nerds like me but can be difficult to keep up with when you've got so many other things on your plate not to mention needing to get the IT group to install them every time.  Review collected by and hosted on G2.com. What problems are you solving with the product?  What benefits have you realized? Having worked in high-tech for many years, I've pretty much used every work management tool out there. Now that I've joined a large corporation that isn't as high-tech, there was tremendous opportunity to innovate enterprise program management operations. The current initiate is a complex cross-functional implementation with interdependencies amongst multiple workstreams and multiple applications. Informal project plans, dispersed manual processes and a heavy dependence on email and meetings has made it difficult to understand priorities, dependencies and share information in a timely manner. Our goal for using Wrike is to provide a central work management tool that provides visibility into the activities within each workstream to facilitate collaboration across the program while seamlessly integrating all workstream plans into a consolidated program plan. Utilizing Wrike as a single source of truth has reduced email volume and provided real-time information and reporting for data-driven planning and problem solving. It's been a game changer for our team and we're just getting started considering Wrike has so many great features!  Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.\"}\n",

A few days ago I checked my credit card, and realized the charges for three months, butI had not used the software since the end of last year as I had told the consultant when we spoke about my intentions for Wrike. Since the I tried refund these bills, but the consulting dont answer me anymore and the contact with the supporte declined my solicitations.

We use it as a Lead tracking system (each new customer has a specific status and workflow), we use it for software renewals for customers (to track annual renewals, their cost, profit and value in the custom calculation fields) .  Basically, having seen and worked with many project management systems, there was nothing that was as customisable as Wrike.

Works nicely to keep track of where the projects are in the process. Keeps all of us on task while managing so many different projects.

Wrike is an outstanding framework for project management that promises unbelievable simplicity and scalability for any project type for any industry. All the integrations and the perfect way to link function between systems are not to be mentioned. The platform was best used for the service and resources.

With Workamajig, you had to open practically 50 side-bar panels to dive into the details of a project, whereas with Wrike, you could basically see everything you needed on one screen (for example, you could see all-at-once if the project is in process or approved, what files are associated with it, what the convo between the people assigned was, etc.) The email notifications are much more helpful and legitimate-looking than Workamajig. I understand the customizability of Workamajig, but our team just didn\\'t have the time to make these customizations, so Wrike was the perfect platform to help get us up to speed quickly. As an art director, another item I have to mention is the ability to mark-up edits on uploaded items and mark them as \"resolved\" as changes are made. This has been the winning feature for myself.

It was great that Wrike had a simple way to get this done so that we could actually be a team that could take requests. This was something we needed as a team from the start and it took way to long to ever get in Workamajig, and was ultimately put-off and forgotten about. For our printing vendor, this has been a useful tool in creating project \"ID #\\'s\" to go along with our SKUs for all of our printed materials available for order.  Review collected by and hosted on G2.com. What do you dislike? At first, we also had a very difficult time trying to distinguish if a new project was considered a \"task\" \"sub-task\" or a \"project\" and we were confused about how each of these things were weighed in the reports. We have a couple of different teams we ask for advice with about Wrike, and each of them advised us to do different things (one team said, a new project would be a \"task\" and the other advised that a new project would be a \"sub-task\" - so our team has been left to determine for ourselves which one works best for us. We are still figuring this out ~5  months into using Wrike. The accordion-style menu can sometimes get confusing (but we have a lot of projects we get added to). If there was a separated bar showing \"my projects that I\\'m assigned to\" and another for  \"projects I just have insight into\" that would help me keep focused when looking at that left-hand side bar.  Review collected by and hosted on G2.com. What problems are you solving with the product?  What benefits have you realized? Our company has been regularly moving folks around, removing and changing teams, so we are trying to create a common platform where our hard work can be noticed and anyone could easily join and see where we\\'ve left-off on a project and be able to quickly pick up the pieces. We get a lot of requests and Wrike has provided the benefit of keeping everything stored, easily searchable and accessible. We now have a legitimate process for accepting project requests WITHIN the system and no longer waste time creating a new project based on an email.  Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.'}\n",

Wrike may be the very best of both worlds: it's simpler and also simpler to utilize than a fantastic tool as Workfront/AtTask, but with even more capabilities than an easy application as Asana. I like the simplicity of talking with colleagues, the power to go by the work of mine, and the many ideas of prospect lists, scaffolding tables and so on.  Review collected by and hosted on G2.com. What do you dislike? In fact, the system is great, but as time passes we've a little delay in monitoring the program. I believe it is a very good goal. You will find lots of good things relating to this system, and also it's truly helpful and also comfortable.  Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.

Wrike's ability to organize and display at the enterprise level is unmatched by other PM tools. Many do project management well, but Wrike delivers on Program and Portfolio management too.  The ability to create custom hierarchies by layering and mixing folders, projects and tasks is unique to Wrike.  The ability to create a holistic view of my programs has alluded me for 20 years. Before Wrike, I frequently had to create disconnected reports or slides to report program status. This approach was time consuming and the data was outdated as soon as I finished.    With Wrike, I can create reports and views of my entire portfolio of work and individually select the projects and folders I wish to include.  I can then filter, sort or group my reports using Wrike's flexible report builder.  My customers no longer have to wait for the weekly status report to get the latest information. With Wrike, I publish reports that are accessible from the web and always have the latest data.  Users can even choose to subscribe to reports so that they automatically receive the report in their email at the frequency of their choosing.  Where most tools force you to decide between agile and waterfall, Wrike works in both conventional and agile environments.  I can create a master schedule that follows more traditional, water fall methods and then use the same tool to manage my agile development teams at a lower level in the plan. Each project or program can follow their own custom workflow for tracking progress.    Wrike's functionality continues to grow and improve.  If you have not looked at Wrike recently, I suggest you give them another try.  Review collected by and hosted on G2.com. What do you dislike? Using a tool with this broad set of functionality can be a little challenging. Wrike's UI could lessen the learning curve by being a little more consistent on the methods and functions available in different views of the UI.  Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.

Wrike is a unique tool where for me it has been possible to develop all my work. I find it excellent the way it has multiple tools that make everything much easier, such as live chat and video calls, completely in real time, a data storage system with tagging and quick search. I like that it has multiple capabilities, useful actions for my work, integrations with other tools that allow to unify all the work and make it a little more agile. Send notifications according to my personalized settings, this way I make sure I have a reminder whenever I need it. The chat system is highly automated and makes our support management a much easier job to do.  Review collected by and hosted on G2.com. What do you dislike? I think the tool has a good cost when you use it individually. But when there are a lot of people, the monthly or annual cost can be much more than we expected to pay just for the functions that they provide us with such a high cost. However, that does not detract from the idea that has served us as a perfect work strategy that has worked for us, as the main tool that allows us to do everything from our office without having to move from our work.

Among so many things to do, we couldn't find the perfect way to do so many tasks without having to switch from one software to another. But with Wrike and its remote management we have it all here, without looking for anything else. Thanks to the integrations we have everything in a single system, in this way we accelerate a lot of pending work. Now we group all the projects on a single platform, where we can easily discuss and transfer files. We provide excellent customer service by answering all our customers' questions almost automatically thanks to the Slackbot that makes chat management a bit easier. Communication has been essential for us at work, so having this tool and helping us maintain effective communication is the best thing that could have happened to us in a long time.

I have to maintain and create multiple video and online training projects. It was always a project management nightmare - including scheduling the various content pieces and their various editors and talent coordination. I have set up Wrike Dashboards for all my work partners, I can at-a-glance follow their progress, modify and/or add new tasks in a snap!\\n The MUST HAVE piece for us was non-internal user file approvals via Wrike. I can send an unlimited amount of \\'file for your approval\\' notices to our outside clients, and none of them need a Wrike license! This is a hard-to-find feature from other PM vendors. When we were shopping for a PM solution, when I asked other vendors about this feature, they\\'d say things like, \"We don\\'t have that, but you can make a PDF and email them that for approval, etc.\" NO THANK YOU... I love having the approval of the file built right into my workflow, and I get email alerts when my clients respond with approvals or feedback. This also works smartly with our internal team approvals as well.\\n \\n Another KEY FEATURE is the ability to make forms... I have replaced my old HELP TICKET software with a new Wrike form that I can publish on the internet. Now my Help Tickets auto-trigger a task for me to investigate and solve. They get email alerts and so do I when the forms are triggered. I\\'ve also created work intake forms for my internal team too! No more emails with fuzzy goals like, \"Would you make this?\" Now I get alerted when work requests come in and the customizable forms let me tailor exactly what I need. Wrikes update reminder emails also helps me make sure tasks get done as specified and on time!  Review collected by and hosted on G2.com. What do you dislike? This is one of the most powerful and integrated software packages I\\'ve used in over 30 years of IT management... changes are saved on the fly - there is nothing I don\\'t like about this product!  Review collected by and hosted on G2.com. What problems are you solving with the product?  What benefits have you realized? I have to build custom online courses with dozens of varying and complex components and sub-steps. Wrike lets me lay out all the steps once, turn it into a blueprint for future projects, and saves huge amount of time tracking where I\\'m at in the design - production - assembly - approval phases.\\n \\n I have one process that takes bout three hours on the clock to complete. Dozens of steps, some very complicated and often done by new hires. I can add screen shots and links to all the components I need for myself, or someone else to complete the steps. I then duplicate these steps out for each new series which ensures me that nothing gets missed in the long chain of events.  Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.'}\n",
